# Intersection Bound Sphere

This sample demonstrates how to find an intersection between the bound sphere and geometry.
The *BoundSphereIntersection.cs* component shows how to use *World.GetIntersection()* to detect static mesh objects located within a spherical volume defined in world coordinates. The sphere is highlighted using the *Visualizer*, and intersected object names are printed to the onscreen console overlay.
