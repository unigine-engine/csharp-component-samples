# Trajectory

This sample demonstrates three types of movement along a predefined path:

+**Red plane**: linear interpolation.
+**Blue plane**: spline interpolation.
+**Green plane**: path from a file.

The sample contains the *PathTrajectorySaver* component that illustrates how to create your own path file, which is opened via the *WorldTransformPath* node. In the Parameters section, you can toggle path visualization on and off, adjust the planes' velocity, or switch between the cameras to have a first-person view from each plane.
