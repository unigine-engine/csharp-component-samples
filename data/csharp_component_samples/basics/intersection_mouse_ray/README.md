# Intersection Mouse Ray

This sample demonstrates how to find an intersection between a ray cast from the camera through the mouse cursor and geometry.
The *MouseRayIntersection.cs* component shows how to use *World.GetIntersection()* to detect static mesh objects intersected by a ray cast from the player's position in the direction pointed by the mouse cursor. The name of the hit object is displayed next to the cursor on the screen.
