# Intersection Bound Box

This sample demonstrates how to find an intersection between the bound box and geometry.
The *BoundBoxIntersection.cs* component shows how to use *World.GetIntersection()* to detect static mesh objects located within a specified world-space axis-aligned bounding box. The box is highlighted using the *Visualizer*, and intersected object names are printed to the onscreen console overlay.
