# Robot Arm

This sample demonstrates how to build a physics-based robotic arm with a kinematic chain composed of six links: one fixed and five movable. Each movable link is connected via a hinge joint (***JointHinge***) and driven by a motor that responds to keyboard inputs.

The arm's **end effector** is a **magnetic gripper** capable of **grabbing, holding, and releasing** dynamic objects in its environment. The gripper and each joint can be controlled independently via key bindings, which are configurable and demonstrated in the *Controls* section.

This setup provides a flexible starting point for creating custom robotic arms with any required number of degrees of freedom (DoF). You can replace manual input with a control system (e.g., inverse kinematics, AI, joystick, or ROS integration) to adapt the robot arm to your specific use case.

**Use Cases:**

+**Simulation &amp; prototyping** of industrial robotic manipulators.
+**Educational environments** to teach principles of robotics, joint control, or physics-based animation.
+**AI training** for robotic arms using reinforcement learning or motion planning.
+**Human-machine interfaces**: test robotic interaction with dynamic environments.
+**Virtual reality** robotics simulations or operator training.
