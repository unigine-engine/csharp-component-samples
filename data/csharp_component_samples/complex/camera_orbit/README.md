# Camera Orbit

This sample demonstrates an orbital camera rotating around a target.
The *CameraOrbit.cs* component enables orbit-style camera movement around a target object using a *PlayerDummy* node. Input is handled via the *CameraControls.cs* component, which provides configurable input controls for camera movement and zoom.

The camera behavior can be customized using the exposed parameters: *Angular Speed, Zoom Speed, Min/Max Distance*, and *Min/Max Vertical Angle*. The *Target* field defines the object the camera orbits around.
