# Arcade

This sample showcases a flexible arcade-style interaction system, built with UNIGINE's C# API. It presents foundational gameplay mechanics commonly used in shooter, and action-style applications. The project serves both as a beginner-friendly learning resource and a base for prototyping more advanced features such as basic non-player behavior or scoring logic.

**Core Features:
**

+**Player Controller:** Control a robot character with keyboard input for movement and rotation.
+**Projectile System:** An automated turret fires projectiles using raycasting for hit detection and visual impact effects.
+**Enemy Turret:** A rotating turret that periodically shoots projectiles at the player.
+**Health System:** The robot takes damage and is destroyed when health reaches zero, with corresponding visual effects and cleanup.
+**Node Spawning &amp; Deletion:** Bullets and particle effects are dynamically created and removed, with timed destruction to manage scene performance.
+**Visual FX (Optional):** Includes particle effects for shooting, impact, and destruction events.

**Use Cases:
**

+**Game Prototyping:** Provides a foundation for building shooter mechanics, or arcade-style gameplay.
+**Physics &amp; Interaction:** Demonstrates raycasting-based hit detection.
+**Learning Tool:** Ideal for beginners exploring the UNIGINE C# API and gameplay scripting.
