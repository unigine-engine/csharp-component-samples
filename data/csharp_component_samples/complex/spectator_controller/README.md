# Spectator Controller

This sample implements a first-person **Spectator camera** controller with configurable movement and physical collision detection using the **Sphere collision shape**, assigned to respond to collisions with geometry (e.g. with terrain) in the world.

Movement parameters such as speed, sprint acceleration, turning rate, and mouse sensitivity can be adjusted in real-time using the sliders in the *Parameters* section.

**Use Cases:**

+Building custom camera tools with physical awareness for scene editing or testing purposes.
+First-person 3D scenes navigation and exploring while preserving configurable interaction with the geometry.
