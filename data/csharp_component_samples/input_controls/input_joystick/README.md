# Joystick Input

This sample demonstrates how to add advanced joystick input handling to a project using the *InputJoystick.cs* component assigned to **NodeDummy**, supporting multiple controllers with real-time axis/button monitoring and force feedback effects in UNIGINE.

It features a **dynamic UI for testing 10+ force feedback types** (springs, vibrations, waves) and automatically handles device connection/disconnection events.

**Use Cases:**

Ideal for racing/flight simulators or any project requiring precise controller input with haptic feedback.
