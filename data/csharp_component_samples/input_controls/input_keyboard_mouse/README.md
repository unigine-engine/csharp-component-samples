# Keyboard And Mouse Input

This sample demonstrates how to add monitoring of keyboard and mouse input, tracking key states, mouse movements, wheel events, and cursor positions across different coordinate systems using the *InputKeyboardAndMouse.cs* component assigned to **NodeDummy**. It displays real-time input data including key presses, mouse deltas, and text input.

The sample shows three mouse handling modes:

+**GRAB** - locks and hides the cursor
+**SOFT** - locks the cursor to the window but keeps it visible
+**USER** - leaves mouse behavior completely under user control.
