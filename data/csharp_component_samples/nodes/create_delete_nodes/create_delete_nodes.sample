		<brief>
			<para>This sample demonstrates how to dynamically create and delete node instances at runtime in UNIGINE.</para>
			<para>A specified <strong nt="1">.node</strong> asset is instantiated repeatedly at timed intervals, with each new instance positioned in a grid pattern. Once a certain number of nodes are active, the oldest ones are automatically removed (first-in, first-out deletion) to maintain a fixed, memory-safe maximum count in the scene.</para>
			<para><strong>Use Cases:</strong></para>
			<ul>
				<li>Object pooling and controlled instancing</li>
				<li>Spawning projectiles, enemies, or temporary effects.</li>
			</ul>
