# Primitives Creation

This sample demonstrates how to create parametric 3D primitives at runtime in UNIGINE. It showcases the use of the **Mesh** class and **ObjectMeshDynamic** nodes to procedurally generate a variety of basic shapes (**Box, Sphere, Cylinder, Capsule, Prism** with a custom number of sides and **Plane**) via code.

Each shape is constructed with a customizable size and resolution, added to a mesh surface, and placed in the world at a designated position. This approach allows dynamic geometry generation for tools, editor extensions, procedural environments, and rapid prototyping.
