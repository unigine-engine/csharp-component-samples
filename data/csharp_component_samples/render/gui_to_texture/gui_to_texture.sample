	<sdk_desc>Rendering GUI onto texture using <i>Gui.Render()</i>.</sdk_desc>
	<desc>
		<brief>
			<para>This sample demonstrates how to render GUI elements into a texture using <ui><link to="gui_class" offset="render_void">Gui.Render()</link></ui>. Instead of drawing directly to the screen, the GUI is redirected to a custom framebuffer, which isolates its rendering pipeline and allows the resulting texture to be applied to materials.</para>
		</brief>
		<para>The <strong nt="1">GuiToTexture</strong> component supports two update modes:</para>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<para>In manual mode, the texture is updated only when explicitly calling <ui>RenderToTexture()</ui> method. This is used in the <strong nt="1">WidgetClock</strong> component, where the GUI (a digital clock) is re-rendered once per second, only when the displayed time changes.</para>
			</li>
			<li>
				<para>Automatic mode is enabled by default and updates the GUI texture every frame. This is demonstrated in the <strong nt="1">WidgetNoSignal</strong> component, where a <ui>"No Signal"</ui> label moves across the screen like a screensaver. Because the position of the widget changes every frame, the texture must be continuously updated to reflect those changes.</para>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<para>The render flow involves saving and clearing the current render state, binding a texture, configuring the viewport, rendering the GUI widgets, and restoring the render state. Mipmaps are also generated to ensure proper filtering at different scales and distances.</para>
		<para>You can use this sample to display dynamic GUI elements on in-game monitors, control panels, or other similar surfaces.</para>
