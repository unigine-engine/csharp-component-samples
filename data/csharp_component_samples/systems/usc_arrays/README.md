# USC Arrays

This sample showcases integration between *C#* and *UnigineScript* by registering external *C#* functions that manipulate *UnigineScript* array types.
The registered functions allow for setting and getting values, generating test data, and enumerating the contents of both *ArrayVector* (indexed container) and *ArrayMap* (associative container).
