# Microprofiler

This sample demonstrates methods for tracking performance and estimating the time spent on different sections of code. For this purpose, it uses **Microprofile**, an advanced CPU/GPU profiler with per-frame inspection support.
Profiling is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing code execution. This analysis helps you understand if any code sections negatively impact the project's speed.
