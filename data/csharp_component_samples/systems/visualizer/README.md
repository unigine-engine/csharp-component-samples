# Visualizer Showcase

This sample demonstrates the full range of features provided by the *Visualizer* class for visual debugging.
The sample illustrates how to use *Visualizer* for debugging node positions, physics vectors, bounding volumes, and custom geometry in both world space and screen space. Use controls to explore the area.

*VisualizerUsage.cs* renders a wide range of primitives including points, lines, boxes, frustums, spheres, capsules, and object bounds using *Visualizer* methods.

*2D* visualizer features can be toggled on and off via the corresponding checkboxes.

Enable or disable depth testing, toggle specific primitives, and inspect how different rendering options behave in real time.
