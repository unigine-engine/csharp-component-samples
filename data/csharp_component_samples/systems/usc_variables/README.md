# USC Variables

This sample demonstrates how to work with different variable types in *UnigineScript* using the *Variable* class from *C#* code.
Various types (*int, long, float, double*), and vector types (*vec3, vec4, dvec3*, etc.), are wrapped in *Variable* objects and passed into a *UnigineScript* callback function.
