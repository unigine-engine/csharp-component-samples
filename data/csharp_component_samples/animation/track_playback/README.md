# Track Playback

This example demonstrates how to use Tracker to animate objects by changing their position, rotation, and scale through tracks created in the **Tracker** tool.

Tracks in code are referred to via names and IDs.

The **TrackPlayback** component uses a C# wrapper for Tracker functionality implemented in the **Tracker.cs** file.
