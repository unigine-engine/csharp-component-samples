		<brief>This sample demonstrates partial blending between two animations using bone-specific interpolation.</brief>
		<para>The <ui>AnimationPartialInterpolation.cs</ui> component plays two skeletal animations simultaneously on a skinned mesh and blends them only for selected bones. The blend weight can be adjusted at runtime using the keyboard.</para>
		<para>Use the <ui>interpolatedBones</ui> array in the <ui>Parameters</ui> window to define which bones are affected by blending. The <ui><link to="objectmeshskinned_class">ObjectMeshSkinned</link></ui> class is used to apply animation layers and interpolate transforms.</para>
