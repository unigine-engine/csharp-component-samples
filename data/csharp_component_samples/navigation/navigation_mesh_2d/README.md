# Navigation Mesh 2D

This sample demonstrates how to calculate and visualize 2D navigation paths using the **Navigation Mesh** object and *PathRoute* class via the C# API. It shows how to build a route between two points on a navigation mesh and renders the result for debugging or visualization purposes.

The main logic is implemented in the **PathRoute2D** component, which initializes a *PathRoute* class instance and uses *PathRoute.Create2D()* to compute the path from a start node to a finish node. If the route is successfully resolved, the path is drawn on screen using *RenderVisualizer()*. The radius parameter is set manually to ensure the generated path accounts for the navigation agent's size, avoiding collisions with nearby geometry.

The sample includes a second component, **NavigationMeshVisualizer**, that renders the **Navigation Mesh** during runtime to help visualize navigable areas.

This setup is useful for prototyping AI navigation, testing route validity, and analyzing the structure of navigable areas in 2D gameplay scenarios.
