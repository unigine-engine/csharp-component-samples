# BodyFracture Shooting Gallery

This sample shows how to simulate projectile-based interactions in a simple shooting gallery setup using **Fracture Body**. When the left mouse button is clicked, a projectile is spawned in front of the camera and propelled forward. Target objects in the scene react to the impact physically and can be fractured using the **Fracture Body** system to simulate realistic destruction effects.

**Use Cases:**

+Prototyping physics-based shooting mechanics.
+Demonstrating **Fracture Body** impulse interactions.
+Testing fracture behaviors in destructible environment setups.
