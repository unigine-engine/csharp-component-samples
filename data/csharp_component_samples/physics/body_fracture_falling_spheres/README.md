# BodyFracture Falling Spheres

This sample demonstrates continuous fracturing of objects using *BodyFracture* class. Spheres are periodically spawned every 3 seconds and fall freely under gravity. Upon collision with the ground, each sphere fractures dynamically into multiple physical fragments.

The sample includes a debug visualization that displays mesh wireframes, providing clear insight into internal mesh structure and fracture patterns generated upon impact.

This example can be used to explore and evaluate destruction mechanics, test mesh-based fracturing setups, and visually analyze breakage behavior in real-time scenarios.
