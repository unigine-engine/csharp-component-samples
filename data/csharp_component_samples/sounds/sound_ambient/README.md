# Sound Ambient

This sample shows the implementation of a component that controls the playback of ambient sound (*AmbientSource*) and allows interactive adjustment of playback parameters using the keyboard.
Background sound helps create a more immersive environment. This example demonstrates a practical way to organize ambient sound using the *AmbientSource* class, including creating a sound source, configuring the settings, and switching between streaming and normal playback modes.
