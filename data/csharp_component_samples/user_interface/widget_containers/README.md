# Widget Containers

Demonstration of various types of widget containers (vertical and horizontal box layouts, paned widgets, tabbed interfaces, group boxes, grid-based container, etc.) you can use when creating a User Interface.
The *WidgetsContainers.cs* component shows how to use various layout and grouping widgets from the *Gui* class to organize interface elements. It demonstrates vertical and horizontal box layouts, paned widgets, tabbed interfaces, group boxes, grid-based containers, and scrollable areas.

Each container is filled with labeled elements and styled with background colors to illustrate their visual separation and hierarchy. The interface is fully constructed and added to the main *GUI* at runtime, then removed on shutdown.
