# User Interface

This sample shows how to generate a User Interface from a description stored in a **.ui** file (*XML* format) via C# API. The sample also demonstrates how to get a UI widget by name via *getWidgetByName()* and subscribe to events to implement custom handling for user actions (particularly selecting *File -&gt; Reload* from the main menu or entering text in the text field on the **EditText** tab).
